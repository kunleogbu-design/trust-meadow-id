# TrustMeadow

TrustMeadow is a decentralized identity and reputation ecosystem that enables privacy-preserving credential verification through zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure mechanisms. The system creates a trustless network where individuals can build verifiable reputation scores across multiple domains without revealing underlying personal data, using an innovative meadow architecture where trust grows organically through interconnected validation nodes.

The platform implements a comprehensive smart contract architecture including an Identity Registry, Credential Vault, Validator Network, Reputation Engine, and Privacy Layer for zero-knowledge proof generation. Users can mint identity tokens containing encrypted credential hashes verified by authorized issuers, while the system employs cryptographic commitments to allow proof of qualifications without exposing actual credentials. The reputation algorithm weighs credibility based on validator stake, historical accuracy, and cross-domain consistency, with token rewards incentivizing honest behavior and slashing mechanisms deterring malicious actors.

TrustMeadow enables granular permission controls allowing users to share only necessary attributes for specific interactions, such as proving age without revealing exact birthdate or demonstrating professional competence without disclosing employer details. The system supports diverse real-world applications including employment verification for remote work, age verification for digital services, academic credential validation, professional licensing for freelance platforms, and credit scoring for DeFi lending protocols. This creates a self-regulating ecosystem where trust emerges naturally from repeated positive interactions while maintaining complete user privacy and data sovereignty.
